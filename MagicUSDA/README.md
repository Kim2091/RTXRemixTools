# Remix USDA Generator
*Written with the assistance of Bing and ChatGPT*

$\color{#f7d26a}{\textsf{Please back up your usda files to a separate folder before running!}}$

This is a script to generate `.usda` files from your gameReadyAssets folder. It detects any of these map types in your folder:
- emissive
- normal
- metallic
- rough

## Usage
How to use this script:
`python MagicUSDA.py -d path\to\gameReadyAssets`

There are some additional functions:

* `-o` - Change the output usda file names.
* `-m` - Split the output USDA files into separate entries for each map type (e.g. mod_emissive.usda, mod_metallic.usda). Works with `-o` to change the base file name.
* `-a` - Add sublayers made with `-m` to the mod.usda file. Not compatible with custom files specified by `-o`, will only modify mod.usda. Works with `-m` and `-o`.
* `-g` - Toggle generating hashes for file names before the suffix. Useful for files with generic names like test.dds. Diffuse textures must be identical to Remix dumps.
* `-s` - Change between the AperturePBR_Opacity and AperturePBR_Translucent material shader types. Using this, you can generate separate .usda files for normal or translucent objects easily
* `-r` - **Currently broken** Specify a separate folder to use as a reference for generating diffuse texture hashes. Searches for files in the reference directory based on file names from the base directory. If not provided, uses the main directory to generate hashes. Useful with folders like captures or game texture rips.

The `.usda` files generated by this script serve to replace textures in your Remix games, allowing you to swap out textures and utilize additional map types to enhance the game's visuals.

This script is intended to be used with original diffuse textures, which are required for it to function correctly. It generates a `mod.usda` file for use in your game through Remix. It was designed with [chaiNNer](https://chainner.app/) in mind, however you can use this with any textures you've created. Be aware that this script will overwrite any pre-existing `mod.usda` files in your directory!
