**How to use this script:**
* Install USD Composer: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/create/
* Once launched, open the Script Editor in Window > Script Editor
* Load your mesh files by dragging it into the pane on the right
* Run the script

**Description:**

The RemixMeshConvert_OV script is only for usage within Omniverse's USD Composer. If you want to process files and folders independently of Omniverse, use RemixMeshConvert in the directory above this one.

**For your final exports to use in-game, please save as USD! USDA files are very inefficient in comparison**
