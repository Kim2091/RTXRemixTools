# RTXRemixTools
These are some tools I've made that are intended for use with Nvidia's RTX Remix. Right now I have 3:

* **MagicUSDA** - Allows you to generate .usda files based on your gameReadyAssets folder

* **LightAdjuster** - A simple script that allows you to adjust light intensity and color temperature in a specified .usda file

* **RemixMeshConvert** - This script will convert meshes to be (more) compatible with Remix

These should hopefully help with setting up mods for Remix quickly and easily.
